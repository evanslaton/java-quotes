# Lab 9: Potent Quotables

## Challenge
* When running the application, donâ€™t read in the quotes file. Instead, make a request to an API to get a random quote.
* Ensure that if your app has errors in connecting to the Internet, you instead display a random quote from your file.
* When a quote comes back from a request, save it in the json file

## Instruction on running - Gradle required
* Clone the repo - https://github.com/evanslaton/java-quotes
* Navigate to the repo in your command line
* Type `./gradlew run`
* Enjoy a quote
